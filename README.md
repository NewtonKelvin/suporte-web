## Packages used
- [**React:**](https://react.dev/) React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.
- [**Typescript:**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
- [**Next:**](https://nextjs.org/) Next.js enables you to create full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.
- [**Tailwind:**](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup
- [**Storybook:**](https://storybook.js.org/) Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It’s open source and free.
- [**Material UI:**](https://mui.com/) MUI offers a comprehensive suite of UI tools to help you ship new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components.
